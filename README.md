# Skills

A collection of agent skills for Claude Code and other coding agents. It brings together two sets:

- **[Design engineering skills](#design-engineering-skills)**: 7 skills by [Emil Kowalski](https://emilkowal.ski) for building better interfaces and animations.
- **[ECC skills](#ecc-skills)**: 311 skills from [affaan-m/ECC](https://github.com/affaan-m/ECC) covering frontend, backend, testing, security, DevOps, agent workflows and more.

## Install

### As a Claude Code plugin

Installs every skill, agent, command and hook at once:

```
/plugin install skills --marketplace akshatjainsonujain2003-sudo/skills
```

On Claude Code versions older than 2.1.275, add the marketplace first:

```
/plugin marketplace add akshatjainsonujain2003-sudo/skills
/plugin install skills@akshat-skills
```

The plugin turns ECC's hooks on by default. To turn them off, or to pick the `minimal`, `standard` or `strict` hook profile, change the plugin's `hooks_enabled` and `hook_profile` options.

### Skills only, with `npx skills`

Works with Claude Code and other coding agents, but installs only skills. Install every skill:

```bash
npx skills@latest add akshatjainsonujain2003-sudo/skills
```

See which skills are available without installing:

```bash
npx skills@latest add akshatjainsonujain2003-sudo/skills --list
```

Install only the skills you want:

```bash
npx skills@latest add akshatjainsonujain2003-sudo/skills --skill emil-design-eng api-design
```

By [Emil Kowalski](https://emilkowal.ski), from [emilkowalski/skills](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills). In Emil's words:

> Knowing whether you made a right choice when it comes to animations, or design in general, is hard. These skills aim to help you get to those right decisions faster.
>
> They are based on my years of experience working at companies like Vercel and Linear.

### Why use it?

Agents don’t have great taste

I have seen plenty of times that agents don’t pick the right ingredients for an animation. An `ease-in` easing for an enter animation when it’s supposed to be `ease-out` ([here’s why](https://emilkowal.ski/ui/7-practical-animation-tips#4.-choose-the-right-easing)). Or they choose a solid border instead of a semi-transparent shadow for your UIs.

All these small things compound and make your interface either amazing, or just... not that great.

As explained in [Agents with Taste](https://emilkowal.ski/ui/agents-with-taste), these skills list all the little mistakes agents can potentially make and explain how to fix them.

This is your shortcut to great interfaces. A shortcut to stand out in a sea of slop.

### Reference

- **[emil-design-eng](./skills/emil-design-eng/SKILL.md)** — The main skill that consists of mostly animation, but also some design advice.
- **[review-animations](./skills/review-animations/SKILL.md)** — Review your animations in a strict way, based on my rules.
- **[improve-animations](./skills/improve-animations/SKILL.md)** — Audit all the animations in your codebase and get prioritized, self-contained plans that any agent can execute.
- **[find-animation-opportunities](./skills/find-animation-opportunities/SKILL.md)** — Search your UI for places that would genuinely benefit from motion, while also telling you what not to animate.
- **[animation-vocabulary](./skills/animation-vocabulary/SKILL.md)** — Get better animations from an AI by telling it exactly what you want by using the right words.
- **[apple-design](./skills/apple-design/SKILL.md)** — Apple’s principles for interface design and fluid motion, distilled from their WWDC design talks and translated for the web.
- **[pick-ui-library](./skills/pick-ui-library/SKILL.md)** — Have your agent pick the right library for the task based on libraries I use and trust, instead of letting AI hand-roll a toast component or install an abandoned package.

## ECC skills

311 skills imported unchanged from [affaan-m/ECC](https://github.com/affaan-m/ECC) at commit `25278e7`. They cover frontend and design, backend and API design, many languages and frameworks, testing, security, DevOps, research, content and agent workflows.

ECC's agents, commands and hooks are included too; see [ECC agents, commands and hooks](#ecc-agents-commands-and-hooks). ECC's rules, MCP configs and installer aren't, so a few skills may mention pieces that aren't here. For those, install [ECC](https://github.com/affaan-m/ECC) itself.

## ECC agents, commands and hooks

Also imported unchanged from [affaan-m/ECC](https://github.com/affaan-m/ECC) at commit `25278e7`. Installing this repo [as a Claude Code plugin](#as-a-claude-code-plugin) sets all of them up. The `npx skills` installer only installs skills; without the plugin, set these up by hand as below.

- **[`agents/`](./agents)**: 71 Claude Code subagents, such as `architect`, `code-explorer` and `build-error-resolver`. To use one, copy its `.md` file into `~/.claude/agents/` (or `.claude/agents/` in a project).
- **[`commands/`](./commands)**: 97 slash commands, such as `/code-review`, `/build-fix` and `/checkpoint`. To use one, copy its `.md` file into `~/.claude/commands/` (or `.claude/commands/` in a project).
- **[`hooks/`](./hooks)**: ECC's Claude Code hook configuration, plus the Node scripts it runs under [`scripts/hooks/`](./scripts/hooks) and [`scripts/lib/`](./scripts/lib) (only the files the hooks need). See [`hooks/README.md`](./hooks/README.md) for what each hook does.

The hooks run Node scripts on every tool call, prompt and session event. Don't paste `hooks/hooks.json` into your settings by hand. It finds its scripts through the plugin root, so enable it by installing this repo as a plugin, or with ECC's own installer (`bash ./install.sh --target claude --modules hooks-runtime --enable-hooks`, run from a clone of ECC).
